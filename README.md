SMU Coding Bootcamp 2019-2020 HW Week 6

A GIPHY API-based GIF search app.

Allows you to search GIPHY for relevant GIFs by clicking on buttons with search terms. A list of starter topics are available at the top of the page, cartoons are the  theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.

The app should take the topics in this array and create buttons on the page.


When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.


When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.


Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
